# Israel-conflict-analysis
It is the conflict analysis between Israel and Palestine from 2000 to 2023(before war of 2023). I have analysed the tension between Israel and Palestine during the years 2000 to 2023 before the war started as people are getting updates regarding the current situation but I wanted to analyse whatever happened between them during these 20 to 23 years and how many fatalities were there and various other details regarding the same.

Technologies/tools used are :-

1) Python
2) SQL
3) plotly
4) pandas
   
The dataset is taken from kaggle and under description, it was written by the author that they have collected the data from the government released data of the Israel Government.

I have done data cleaning, data preprocessing and initial analysing using SQL and then used SQL and pandas with python for further data manipulation and analyzing the data. I used psycopg2 to link the database with python so that I can link both of them together and use SQL queries in python for further data manipulation and analyzing.

I have used Python and visualization library i.e 'plotly' for the visualization of the data.
